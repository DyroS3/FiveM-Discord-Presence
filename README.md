# **FiveM Discord Rich Presence**

## The first iteration of a fully customizable, open source script to create a custom, high effort rich presence for your server.

# Installation

 1. Download the latest release from the Releases tab
 2. Place the folder inside of the archive anywhere in your resources folder
 3. Configure the script according to the config file and the [Wiki](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Configuration)
 4. Put `ensure Discord-Presence` anywhere in your server.cfg
 5. Restart your server or start the resource through TxAdmin

# Usage

The script itself does not have any usable commands/events.

# Issues?
Create a new [issue](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/issues/new)

# Contributing new presence styles
#### Do you have a new style for the presence in mind and want it included? You can do 2 things:

 1. Add it into the script yourself according to the [Wiki](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Creating-a-new-style) and then submit a pull request.
 2. Create a new issue describing how you want to look it, and depending if I like it I might add it into the script.

# Final words

This is my first proper script (Before creating this I only edited scripts I found online) so any criticism/improvements are appreciated.
